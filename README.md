# Existence Is Pain

The name is based off of [this memorable scene](https://youtu.be/QrQZg-gNC_k?t=18s) from Rick & Morty.

This is going to be a large multiplayer version of the classic game Snake. The goal isn't to be original. I want to learn some stuff about video game programming, especially multiplayer game servers.

# Client

The client is going to be JavaScript. I'd like to try two versions of the client.

## 2D

[Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/)

## 3D

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

# Server

In order to learn and expand my knowledge, I'm going to attempt make the same backend in three different languages. Why these particular three? Because I want to learn them.

I'd also like to somehow encorporate [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) into the project.
